This repository contains [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and
[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) models used in the research

Models and notebooks are included in [`src`](src). To install
requirements needed to run code from this repositiory, first create a
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html),
and then run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
