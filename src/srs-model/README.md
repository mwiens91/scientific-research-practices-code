# SRS model

Due to the complexity of the SRS model, we will not provide a complete
description of the model here. Instead, refer to the description in the
thesis.

Results from the SRS model are obtained by simulating the model using
Mesa. The Jupyter notebook [`srs-model.ipynb`](srs-model.ipynb)
contains analyses of these results while the code for the model itself
is contained in the [`model`](model/) directory.
